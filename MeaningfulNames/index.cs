/*
 * 1. Whenever you would like to name a meaningful variable/method/class name, ignore a/an/the even though if you write it
 *    in a literal sentence you would need use them.
 * 2. For example, byte* pointerToFirst. If you write it in literal, it would be pointer to the first (element). But in coding
 *    variable name, you can't use the. Take another example, method name IsStraightLine, not IsAStraightLine.
